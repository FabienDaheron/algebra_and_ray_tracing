Structures for ray-tracing software 


Objective: To carry out ray-tracing by implementing surfaces described by a structure or polynomial (not yet finite) in order to calculate ray propagation in a space filled with optical systems.

Basis, ReferenceFrame, Vector and Point: these are the fundamental classes of the project. Their role is to facilitate the representation of rays and optics. They make it easy to work in several bases adapted to different optics, simplifying their use.
